# IMDb Box Office Revenue Prediction 

<h2> Introduction </h2>
This project is made by students of <a href="https://gehu.ac.in/"> GEHU Bhimtal </a> where we have used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata"> TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset </a> and 6 Machine Learning Regression Algorithms which were first trained on the given dataset and then we got the best Regression Model which was used later used to predict the revenue of Movie.

<h2> Problem Statement of Project </h2>
Predicting a Movie's Box Office based on factors like Budget, Genre, Runtime, and Release Date is the issue that we are trying to address. Due to the influence of numerous elements including competition, negative reviews, and marketing initiatives, it is a difficult process. We intend to compare the performance of various machine learning models, including <ins> Linear Regression, K-Neighbors Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Decision Tree Regression, XGB Regression, and Random Forest Regression</ins> in order to find the most effective model for forecasting box office revenue.

<h2> Technology and Tools Used </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Python [for Coding] </li>
  <li> Streamlit Framework [to create application/UI to interact </li>
  <li> Microsoft Excel [for handling dataset] 
</ul>
